I couldnt get the game to load the correct answers.
whenever I would click the right answer it would choose the one below it. 
Whenever I clicked the wrong or right answer it wouldnt move on to the next page.
it would do everything I would ask it to, but the things listed above.
Any help on how to fix this would be much appreciated.
Couldnt figure out why my background was being difficult.
